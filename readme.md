# Digital Signage - Basic

This Android application uses Google's embedded Text to Speech engine to read the text out loud thats visible on the 
screen.

The text is configurable and localizable within corresponding values directory.

Since TTS uses device's default localization to read stuff, it is recommended to change only target localization 
directory.

I took some parts of motion detector from squareup's shake detection library.

## The idea:

Idea comes from this: We had a open-office where other people keeping door open, but there was a lot of noise coming 
from outside. So I was the person who is farthest from the door. Actually, standing up going, closing door and coming
 back nearly taking a minute.
 
Also you know I had headphones but sometimes you want to go free. So I made this app and installed on tablet which is
 then sticked to door with two sided tape (n00bish stuff). So when door moved it speaks to shut the door off. Which 
 is nice because people don't read text taped on door or anywhere...
